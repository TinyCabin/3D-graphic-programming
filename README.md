# WebGL 3D Graphics Project

This project demonstrates a series of WebGL-based 3D graphics using the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The main goal is to gradually build up the functionality for a 3D scene as: basic primitives, rotation, and mouse-based camera control.

## Project Structure

- **lab1_primitives**: Basic 3D primitives (cube) rendered using WebGL.
- **lab2_rotate**: Adding rotation to the 3D object.
- **lab3_mouse**: Implementing mouse-based camera control for a freelook-style navigation.

---

### Controls:
- **W**: Move forward.
- **S**: Move backward.
- **A**: Strafe left.
- **D**: Strafe right.
- **Mouse Movement**: Look around (in Lab 3).
- **Click**: Lock mouse pointer (in Lab 3).
- **Esc**: Close the window (prompt on Escape key press).
